## Scripts for transcriptomic and germline IGHV analysis ##

This repository contains the scripts utilised in the study - Novel Polymorphic and Copy Number Diversity in the Antibody IGH Locus of South African Individuals by Marsden et. al (2024)

Briefly, the study aimed to examine the genetic diversity of IGHV genes in the transcriptomes and germlines of a South African population. These scripts parse various outputs to assign novely to alleles and also determine the presence of IGHV gene duplication. Please refer to the paper for more information. The docstrings in the scripts detail necessary inputs and relevant libraries.
